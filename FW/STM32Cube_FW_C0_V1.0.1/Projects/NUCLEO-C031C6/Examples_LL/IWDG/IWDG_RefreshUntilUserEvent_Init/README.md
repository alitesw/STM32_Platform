## <b>IWDG_RefreshUntilUserEvent_Init Example Description</b>

How to configure the IWDG peripheral to ensure periodical counter update and
generate an MCU IWDG reset when a User push-button is pressed. The peripheral
is initialized with LL unitary service functions to optimize for performance and size.

**Example Configuration**:

Configure the IWDG (prescaler, counter) and enable it.
Infinite refresh of the IWDG down-counter done in the main loop.

**LED4** is blinking fast & continuously.

**Example Execution**:

When User push-button is pressed, the down-counter automatic refresh mechanism is
disable and thus, reset will occur. After a reset, when re-entering in the main,
RCC IWDG Reset Flag will be checked and if we are back from a IWDG reset the **LED4** will be switch ON.

Waiting a new User push-button pressed to re-activate the IWDG
